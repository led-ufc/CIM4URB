CIM4URB is City Information Modeling research project. Here we share some definitions for Grasshopper 3D for retrieve data from geodatabases. The definitions are formated as "User Objects" to make it easier to use. 

What we currently have here is a alfa version of the sistem. The objects work with Rhino 5 and use some components of the plugin Slingthot!, made by Nathan Miller. Slingshot! can be downloaded in https://www.food4rhino.com/app/slingshot.
