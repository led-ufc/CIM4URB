CIM4GH is City Information Modeling research project. Here we share some definitions for Grasshopper 3D for retrieve data from geodatabases. The definitions are formated as "User Objects" to make it easier to use. 

What we currently have here is a alfa version of the sistem. The objects work with Rhino 5 and use some components of the plugin Slingthot!, made by Nathan Miller. Slingshot! can be downloaded in https://www.food4rhino.com/app/slingshot.

There are also some components made whith gh_python. So, if you are using rhino 5, you should install the gh_python plugin: https://www.food4rhino.com/app/ghpython.

We strongly recommend using the False Start Toggle function that is part of Ladybug, an environmental analysis plugin started by Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari in 2012. Here we provide the .gha file that can be installed separately. To access the other Laybug components, go to: https://www.food4rhino.com/app/ladybug-tools.
